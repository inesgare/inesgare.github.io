# Hi! My name is Inés García-Redondo 

I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in the AIDOS group at the University of Fribourg, working with [Prof. Bastian Rieck](https://bastian.rieck.me/).

My research is at the intersection of algebraic topology and geometry, and machine learning. I am interested in developing new methods that help us extract "shape" features from data, and to leverage them to understand modern deep learning models. 

I recently completed my PhD at the [London School of Geometry and Number Theory](https://lsgnt-cdt.ucl.ac.uk/), a joint programme between Imperial College London, University College London, and King's College London. I was based at Imperial College, working alongside [Prof. Anthea Monod](https://sites.google.com/view/antheamonod/home).  

My thesis was titled *Topological Invariants for Data: Duality, Stability, and Applications to Machine Learning and Statistical Inference*. You can check a copy [here]().
